## About OpenBench
OpenBench is building the future of early drug discovery. In stark rejection of the prevailing ‘fee-for-service’ hit discovery paradigm, we operate on a ‘fee-for-success’ basis: OpenBench’s biotech collaborators only pay once we identify and confirm potent, developable leads. Our powerful proprietary virtual screening platform uniquely enables OpenBench’s success-driven approach. 

Working at OpenBench means working in close collaboration with biotech companies on the cutting edge of target-based drug discovery. Our success-driven model demands constant innovation in the practical applications of virtual screening technology. We require a high degree of scientific acumen and rigor to consistently deliver chemical series that advance our collaborators’ high-impact R&D programs.

OpenBench is a remote-first company based in San Francisco with operations across North America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania.

## The Role
OpenBench is hiring a scientist with expertise in computational drug discovery to join the discovery team. The role requires practical experience in executing structure-based virtual screens from structure preparation to experimental validation.

The role is responsible for maximizing successful outcomes in early discovery collaborations. The scientists will evaluate protein structural data to determine ligandability and estimate achievable potency, perform virtual screens of multi-billion compound libraries using OpenBench’s screening platform, parse and analyze assay readouts, and drive potency and physicochemical improvements through design-make-test-analyze (DMTA) cycles.

## Responsibilities

- Diligence biophysical characteristics of protein binding sites, including literature review of medicinal chemistry data, to determine their feasibility for structure-based virtual screening
- Diligence assay cascades to identify sources of scientific risk 
- Execute multi-billion compound virtual screens, start to finish, using local and cloud compute resources
- Meet with new and existing partners to understand scientific requirements
- Report results to our collaborators and the OpenBench team

## Required qualifications
The following qualifications are required to be taken into consideration for this role:

- Effective written communication. Our global team works asynchronously and fosters a strong writing culture.
- Ph.D., or Masters & industry experience, in structural biology, chemistry, computational biology/chemistry, biophysics, or related fields
- Knowledge of early drug discovery workflows (target validation, hit discovery, hit-to-lead)
- Demonstrated experience in computational drug discovery and working with experimental data
- Strong proficiency with Python, Python packaging software (e.g. pip, conda), and UNIX/Linux command line 
- Hands-on experience with RDKit (or alternatives such as OpenBabel or CDK), high-performance compute or cloud computing
- Capable of working in a remote start-up environment requiring self direction and professionalism

## Preferred Qualifications / Skills:
At OpenBench, we firmly believe in on-the-job training and improvement. Any of the following skills would boost your application, but are not essential to succeed in this role:

- Hands-on knowledge of molecular dynamics, molecular modeling, or related biophysical modeling techniques
- Biotech industry experience in drug discovery or research and development
- Experience conducting wet-lab experiments

## Compensation and Benefits:
- Salary $110,000-160,000 based on prior experience, qualifications, and equity preference
- Equity 0.25%-0.5% as a common stock option (ISO/NSO) package with a 4-year vesting period
- Eligibility for cash bonus(es) 
- Healthcare and retirement benefits (U.S. hires)
- Fully-covered medical, dental, and vision insurance
- 401(k) contribution matching
- Access to R&D funding
- Flexible work schedule. Some availability between 12-5 PM, Pacific Standard Time, is required 
- Annual corporate retreat
- In-office option in San Francisco’s SoMa district
- Unmatched visibility into cutting-edge virtual screening applied to a broad range of discovery targets
- Unmatched practical experience in early drug discovery
